# Iris_data_project

Importing the necessary libraries, loading the dataset form scikit learn

Checking the data types and descriptive statistics of the iris data set

Data visualization using scatter plots, box plots and pairplots to check how the parameters are  related

Correlation analysis, heatmap  to check how the variables are correlated to the target variable species.

Model selection using K nearest neighbors for classifying the unseen labels

cross validating the model and training it, testing using X_test data and calculating the accuracy score

Dispaying the confusion matrix

Used cross vadlidation to reduce overfitting and also to select best features

Used the best features n_neighbors to again fit the model and obtain better prediction results
